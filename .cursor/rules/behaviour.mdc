# Behaviour

- Never add features unless I explicitly specify them.
- Never make changes or corrections that I have not specifically requested.
- Separate each functionality into appropriate modules/packages.
- Module/package line count should not significantly exceed 500 lines.
- Aim to produce reusable code and avoid repetition.
- Always create builds using the [build.bat](mdc:build.bat) file.
